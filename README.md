# Volleypong-online
A volleyball/pong hybrid online game I made to play with friends over quarantine. Uses p5.js for frontend and node.js for the backend

I made this game because I had the idea long ago, but didn't possess the programming knowledge to make it work. I wanted to learn
node.js before, and when a few friends told me they wanted to play this game with me, I decided it would be the perfect opportunity. 

This game is currently being hosted online at volleypong-online.herokuapp.com! If you want to play, one person has to host the game by
adding /server to the end of the url. The other player can proceed with the link above and both should be connected to the game

Controls:
  For the /server player, the A and D keys are used to move right and left, while the W key is used to shoot the ball to the far end of the
  court whereas the S key shoot the ball closer to the net

  For the regular player, the same mechanics for the /server player are repeated except with the use of arrow keys. 

Note:
- The game might be laggy for the regular player (based on some personal testing), though it may just be my wifi
- I have not added multiple party support, so I am not sure how multiple people using this game at the same time would work (my assumption
  is that in worst case scenario, the players would get mixed up).
